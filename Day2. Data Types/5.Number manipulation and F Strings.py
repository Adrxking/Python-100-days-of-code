# This file contains how we can manipulate numbers and F Strings

# Get the round with 2 decimals
result = round(8/3, 2)

# For divide by 2 again
result /= 2

# We can do the following instructions too
# result += 1
# result -= 1
# result *= 1
# result /= 1
# result **= 1
# result %= 1

# F String --> Formatted string literals
print(f"your score is {result}")
